# Effective population of places

This project spins off a challenge set by Jacques Lévy to come up with a method to define the effective population of places. He had sent the challenge to the Chôros group by [email on November 12 2020](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sjinko/c59e8ada7adfd6add573796e5e7af154/raw/365fe1cbe00e9f7156500bcd3f412f42531f3930/levy-email-choros-20201112).

On November 19, I offered my [response to the group](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sjinko/da34092a126305717078b101129c4a79/raw/df3b5aac5101ec6e4b177d7493ecf0f042ee71b0/koseki-email-choros-20201219) by email (FR).
